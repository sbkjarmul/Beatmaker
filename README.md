# Beatmaker

I would like to present you my first javascript based project. The beatmaker is a tool for making music with some fun.

## About the project

A vision of the project came to me during a javascript course. The layout of the website comes from my previous project, which supposed to be an music event website. That design fits perfectly to it!

### Build with

I created this theme using CSS pre-processor:

- SASS

Frameworks that I used in my project:

- JQuery
- RoundSlider

## UI Design

At the beginning, I prepared an UI project using Adobe XD. I like this stage, because I need to be creative and rearch for new solutions.

## Landing page

On the hero section I used paralax effect. There are several layers and every single object is moving with his own speed, based on scroll position. I cut them out of one image using Adobe Photoshop. The pictures on my site come from unsplash.com.

## Beatmaker app

Beatmaker is simply build and easy in using.

Attributes of the beatmaker:

- five rounded sliders, which you can use to choose sounds
- horizontal slider for set up rate expressed in bpm (beat per minute)
- play button
- music console

![Control section](https://github.com/sbkjarmul/Beatmaker/blob/master/img/control-section.jpg)

After choosing right tracks and setting rate, you have to active the console keys. In order to activate the beat, you have to click on the choosed square. After the click, the key should light up with the color of the sound, which it represents. When you set up everything, click a play button to run a console.

At any time you can add or delete during playing. Additionally the icons in the circles, located in the middle of rounded sliders, allow you to mute the sound, without unclicking the path.
