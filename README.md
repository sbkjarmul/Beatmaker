# Beatmaker

I would like to present you my first javascript based project. The beatmaker is a tool for making music with some fun.

## About

A vision of the project came to me during a javascript course. The layout of the website comes from my previous one, which was supposed to be an music event website. That design was fit perfectly to it!

### UI Design

Firstly, I prepared an UI project in Adobe XD.
The first step was making an UI in Adobe XD.

### Landing page

On the hero section I used a something like paralax effect. There are several layers and every single object is moving with his own speed, based on scroll position. I cut them out of one image and I used photoshop. The pictures on my site comes from unsplash.com.
